## Our Architecture

Our physical infrastructure is combined with a network of public and private sentry nodes on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Providers, OVHcloud, Digital Ocean, and other public cloud platforms. We limit public internet connectivity to our physical validator nodes. Our facilities are connected to AWS & GCP using direct connections with VPN backup and to other cloud platforms using VPNs.

## Ecosystem Contributions

We are active members of the Terra validator community, and we build tools for the network, like Hubble, our staking explorer.
