# Stakin

![Stakin](https://i.ibb.co/HGcYpYN/Stakin-Banner.png)

Stakin is an infrastructure operator for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) public blockchain, offering public delegation and staking-as-a-service. With our products, token holders can earn interests on their holdings and shape the future of the networks in which they believe.

At Stakin, the whole team is very optimist on the future of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. We believe it can improve the distribution of wealth and leads us towards a better-decentralized future while being energy-efficient and thus sustainable.

We've been validating on Terra Money since genesis and are a strong supporter of the Terra and Cosmos ecosystems.

- Terra Money (LUNA)
- Cosmos Network (ATOM)
- Irisnet (IRIS)
- Kava Labs (KAVA)
- E-Money (NGM)
- Persistence (XPRT)
- Regen Network (REGEN)
- Tezos (XTZ)
- Icon (ICX)
- Solana (SOL)

## Our Architecture

We understand the importance of providing a highly available architecture with 24/7 uptime and monitoring. Leveraging on our experience on other Proof-of-Stake networks, we run multiple nodes in a sentry architecture using multiple cloud providers such as AWS and Digital Ocean, and tools such as Grafana for constant monitoring and alerting.

#### _Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability_

_Staking and cryptocurrencies investment involves a high degree of risk and there is always the possibility of loss, including the loss of all staked digital assets. Additionally, delegators are at risk of slashing in case of security or liveness faults on some PoS protocols. We advise you to do your own due diligence before choosing a validator._
