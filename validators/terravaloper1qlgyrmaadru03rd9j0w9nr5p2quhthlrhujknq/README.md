# Interdimensional Cable (IDC)

A strong community needs strong decentralized infrastructure. Interdimensional Cable is a personal passion project of mine. I have been supporting the Terra chain and community with my validator since 2021. I've been a recipiant of the TDP program and will continue to support other initiatives. After I graduate, I hope to make Interdimensional Cable an IBC relayor from Terra to other cosmos chains. If you have ideas for what else I can help buidl on Terra or in Cosmos shoot me an email and let’s talk! And in the meantime, consider delegating some luna to my validator! 

Wubba Lubba dub-dub!
