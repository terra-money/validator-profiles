Staker Space started as hobby with one PoS project and turned into a operation over time. We are interested in how all different blockchains will live on and root in society. Validating is just one piece of the puzzle in that. 

Staker Space wants to expand the pieces from validating to developing solutions, not only on Terra but on Web3 in general. 

## Team

Our team is 1-member strong but has deep interests in blockchains.

## Our Architecture

Our validator is on a bare-metal and is running redundant VPS in case of maintenance. 

All nodes have 24/7 monitoring, alerting, and analytics, including the oracle voting node.
