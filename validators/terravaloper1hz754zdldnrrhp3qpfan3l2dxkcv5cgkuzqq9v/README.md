## Our Architecture

Consensus Networks offers a multi-cloud, hybridized network architecture that is spread across our own physical infrastructure and key management in data centers and public cloud providers. We use highly available sentry architectures to limit public internet connectivity to our validator node. 

## Ecosystem Contributions

We are active members of the Terra community and have been involved since genesis. We are actively looking for projects to integrate Terra with and are eager to contribute our development, infrastructure, or research capabilities where we feel we can add value.
