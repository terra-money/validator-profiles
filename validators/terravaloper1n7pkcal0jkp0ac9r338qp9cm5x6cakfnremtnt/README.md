## About us

Even though the concept of Blockchain is new to the world, it is a continuation of a very human story. Humans have always found ways to reduce uncertainty. We rely on third parties today to reduce uncertainty whereas blockchain reduces uncertainty with the help of pure mathematics. At AUDIT.one, we are firm believers in the future of Decentralization. We believe that The Validators of today will be the Auditors of tomorrow. We run Validators for networks that we genuinely believe in and contribute to the growth of these networks in every possible way.
