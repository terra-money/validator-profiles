# Pegasus Labs

## Our Vision

Like every other true blue Terra community member, we believe in decentralization and access to financial products as a basic need for every person on our planet. We plan to follow this vision and build censorship resistant and trustless dApps on the Terra blockchain. UST and LUNA will become integral components of the entire blockchain multiverse eventually, and we want to be a part of that. 

## Our Team

Pegasus Labs consists of members with various backgrounds, who have been working in the crypto space since 2016. We have built a number of successful projects from the ground up. To maintain our anonymity and stay true to the censorship resistant movement on the Terra ecosystem, we will not be revealing these projects. You can trust that we have a good balance of competent developers, marketers, and community managers. Most who have experience not just in the crypto space but also traditional businesses.
