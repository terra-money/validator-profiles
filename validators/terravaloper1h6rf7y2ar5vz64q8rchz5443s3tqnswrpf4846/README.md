## Our Architecture

**Highly Reliable and Secure**
We use Kubernetes to distribute across multiple cloud providers, and have never been slashed, hacked, or experienced extended downtime in 2+ years of operation.

**Non-Custodial**
You are in complete control of your private keys and funds throughout the staking process.

**Flexible Go-To-Market**
Delegate to our public validator or let us operate a separate white-labeled validator on your behalf.

**Broad Asset Coverage**
Live on 20 PoS mainnets including Centrifuge (at launch!), Tezos, Cosmos, Decred, Terra and Livepeer. Operating on 15+ testnets launching in 2020 including Centrifuge, Polkadot, Cardano, Keep, NuCypher and Oasis.

**Block-Level Reporting**
Designed for funds admins and accountants, the reporting includes all staking and delegation transactions on a calendar basis.
