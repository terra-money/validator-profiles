# Nexus Event (2.0!)

Nexus Event, the event which causes a new timeline to arise from the "sacred timeline." It's kind of like a hard fork on the new chain, lol! This is your chance as a variant to disrupt the status quo and break the shackles of the centralized economy. Join us and become one of the variants who will bring dApps to your common man.

## Team

We might not have a deep bench, but we strive for exceptionalism. If you're interested in joining our team, please reach out to our contact information. We are in need of a communication/branding specialist.

## Our Architecture

Think multi-national corporation cloud hosting solution. If it goes down, the world is probably ending.

## Ecosystem Contributions

We're in it for the long haul and have the bills to prove it from the Columbus-4 / Tequila-09 days. 

We hope to keep comissions low and pass along the savings to you.
