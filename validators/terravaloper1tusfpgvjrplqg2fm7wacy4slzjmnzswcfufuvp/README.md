## Our Architecture
We use a Sentry-Validator architecture to ensure that our validator is safely protected. The sentry nodes, which are crucial in securing our architecture are distributed in multiple regions so that the failure of one region does not affect our validator.

We have customized our own Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring purposes, allowing us to be aware of our Server and Validator status 24/7 and be quick to fix problems in emergency situations.
