## Highest APY, Auto-Compounding (via BASE token), Bare-Metal Hardware Validator! 

The Validator offers two types of delegations: 
- Regular LUNC staking, which provides standard ~14% rewards
- Enhanced LUNC Staking via BASE Protocol, which offers enhanced rewards of 28% APY & above (as high as 85% APY in past).

One must use the BASE dApp in order to become an Enhanced Delegator and qualify for the Higher APY%. Normal 21-day unstaking timeline remains the same for Enhanced Staking.

To increase decentralization, we utilize a Bare-Metal Hardware Validator, not a VaaS (Validator-as-a-Service) in the cloud.

Commissions earned are used to acquire BASE tokens, which are then airdropped to Enhanced Delegators on a monthly basis. The size of the airdrop depends on the amount of BASE held, with minimum airdrop amounts in place (2X of transaction Fees).

By delegating to the LBUN Project, you support the BASE protocol which burns LUNC with each transaction through the 0.5% chain Tax. Additionally, we collect an extra 0.6% for a flex account that can also be used to burn LUNC.
