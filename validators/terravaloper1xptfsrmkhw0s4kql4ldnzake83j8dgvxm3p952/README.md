# RnodeC

Just a small team, dedicated to the dream.

If you build it they will come.  Maybe!

We are a professional Proof-of-stake validator operator, committed to delivering high quality services to our customers and the community.  

## Our Architecture

We are run our validator within the world's most highly secure and reliable infrastructure:  The Cloud (GCP to be exact)

Less specifically, we are learning about Terra and hardening our architecture very fast!  

But for real, we operate an HA and fault tolerant Sentry-style architecture.  We love to improve, so please feel free to reference [our tools and scripts used for creating and managing this environment](github.com/RnodeC/terra-git) and reach out with thoughts, critiques, suggestions.
