# RnodeC

Just a small team, dedicated to the dream.

We are a Proof-of-Stake-Validator operator, building on many years of professional systems administration experience.  We are committed to delivering high quality services to our customers and the community.  

## Our Architecture

We are running our validator within the world's most highly secure and reliable infrastructure:  The Cloud (GCP to be exact)

Less specifically, we are hardening our architecture as quickly as we are learning about the beautiful world of Terra!  

But for real, we operate an HA and fault tolerant Sentry-style architecture.  We love to improve, so please feel free to reference [our tools and scripts used for creating and managing this environment](github.com/RnodeC/terra-git) and reach out with thoughts, critiques, suggestions.
