## 7 reasons to choose the BTC.Secure for delegation

1. We have been successfully **validating Terra since the genesis classic** (since April 24, 2019, more than 3 years) and **always update** the validator infrastructure **on time**. BTC.Secure is **never jailed**.

We have a competent infrastructure setup with dedicated servers for the validator, backup, and sentry nodes, and we also have our own monitoring and notification system for missing block signatures, which gives us the opportunity to keep **uptime close to 100%** and we are in the **list of the best** in terms of **missed blocks** among **all Terra validators**.
3. We **maintain validator in Terra testnet**, which is also reliable and have an uptime as close to 100% as possible. This is important for the Terra developers to test new updates and helps to improve the Terra ecosystem.
4. We **participate in all the votes** in Terra and make informed decisions, carefully studying the proposals.
5. We have created and are developing the knowledge base on the Terra ecosystem — **BTC.Secure Learn** in [English](https://learn.btcsecure.io/terra) & [Russian](https://learn.btcsecure.io/ru/terra).
6. We are confident in the quality of our service and offer the [Staking Services Agreement](https://btcsecure.io/agreement), according to which we guarantee our delegators **100% validation stability in Terra** (100% Service Level Agreement).
7. Our company is located in the **United States** as a corporation **BTC.Secure Inc.** and we provide staking services in **full compliance with the laws**.

We love new technology and believe that using technology correctly can change the world and make people’s lives better.

For our company the **blockchain** is that technology. We have been working for over 4.5 years in the digital finance and assets field. We started with crypto trading activity, where our main principles were **security** and **reliability**.

Bitcoin (BTC) was the first cryptocurrency, we started with it and learned how to provide the most stable trading service possible to customers.

That’s how the **BTC.Secure** brand was born, since Bitcoin is the symbol of the blockchain and everything related to it, you can consider our brand name to mean “Digital currency and assets in good hands”

The goal of **BTC.Secure is:**

> Raise the bar for communication and exchange of valuable assets using blockchain technology.

We create and maintain highly accessible infrastructure for blockchain networks based on Proof-of-Stake technology and now work in the **Minter**, **Terra** and **IRIS** blockchains.

We are legally registered in the United States as **BTC.Secure Inc.** in the state of Delaware and we act with **full compliance with the law**, which matters a lot in the crypto industry, where blockchain companies are often in a grey area or don’t exist at all.

We work with the online bank **Mercury** from San Francisco, which specializes with technological startups and helps us deal with finance in the most efficient way possible to provide our customers with the most reliable staking service possible.

Staking doesn’t imply direct control over customers’ funds, but it does imply that we, as the staking provider, are required to support a 100% functional infrastructure under any amount of pressure in the blockchain. Since it’s our activity that decides how fast and stable the blockchain will work, and consequentially, our customers’ income.

The United States has the most compatible law with the crypto industry, that’s why we, like many of the more successful projects, are located there.

**This further emphasizes our high standards:**

> Reliability and security with no strings attached.
